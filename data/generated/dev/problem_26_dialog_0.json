A double-load vending machine sells 400 items whereas a single-load machine sells 325 items. The double-load machine needs to be re-stocked five times every month and uses 30 units of electricity every month. The single-load machine needs to be re-stocked two times every month and uses 10 units of electricity every month. Since the single-load machine is smaller and easier to fit, there must be at least 10 single-load models. However, due to the storage capacity, management prefers to have twice as many double-loads than single-load machines. Further, the supplier needs to sell at least 10000 items every month, and can use at most 600 units of electricity. How many of each vending machine type should the supplier purchase to minimize the total number of times restocked?",
