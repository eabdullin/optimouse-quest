The all-in-one manufacturing line is more efficient and can output 10000 orders per day while the decoupled manufacturing line can output 7000 items per day. The all-in-one manufacturing line requires 5 workers per day while the decoupled manufacturing line requires 10 workers per day. The grocery store sushi supplier must be able to satisfy at least 150000 orders per day and has allocated a budget to hire 135 workers. Since the decoupled manufacturing line is less efficient, at most 35% of the production can be decoupled manufacturing lines. However, there are some legacy factories remaining that already have decoupled manufacturing lines and about 10% of workers are trained on these older methods. Therefore, at least 10% must be decoupled manufacturing lines. How many of each manufacturing line should the sushi supplier plan for to reduce the total number of manufacturing lines?",
