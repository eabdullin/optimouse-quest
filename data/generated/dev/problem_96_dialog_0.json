    "problem_statement": "A skiing resort has two methods of getting their customers up to their resort. They can either use a gondola, or a large bus. On average, a gondola can transport skiers and snowboarders at a rate of 20 people per minute whereas a large bus can transport at a rate of 5 people per minute. However, gondolas cost the resort a lot to maintain and at most 40% of the transportation methods implemented can be gondolas. Since large buses are easier to implement, there must be at least ten times more large buses than gondolas. If the manufacturer wants to move at least 500 customers every minute up the mountain, find the minimum transportation implementations that can be used.",
