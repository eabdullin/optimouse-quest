With the information you've provided, we can still get a good estimate of what we're dealing with.\n\nSince we don't have specific rates for things like heat generation or how the production rates change based on how the heat is divided, we would have to make some approximations for the time being.\n\nTo reach your minimum production levels as fast as possible, you may want to focus on running multiple instances of the same reaction at the same time since you have no limits on how many of each reaction type you can run simultaneously. This could speed up the production process significantly.\n\nGiven the maximum heat as 1400 units per minute, and with each run of the reaction X requiring 18 units of heat, you could theoretically run about 77 instances of reaction X at the same time (since 1400/18 is almost 78, but we cannot have a fraction of a reaction). Doing so would produce approximately 2695 au of acidic and 5775 au of basic liquid per minute, which seems to drastically exceed the requirement.\n\nSimilarly, running reaction Y at full capacity (considering 1400/12 is about 116) would yield around 4872 au of acidic and 4060 au of basic liquid per minute.\n\nPlease note that these are rudimentary calculations and actual outcomes might differ. From these calculations, it seems we would exceed the minimum requirements in a single minute. Therefore, potentially, you could limit the number of instances of each reaction run in each minute to avoid waste and still meet your minimum production levels.\n\nDo these initial approximations help? If yes, then could you try these recommendations and let me know the actual outcomes?"
