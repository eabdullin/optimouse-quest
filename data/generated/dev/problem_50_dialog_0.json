She has two selections of protein shakes, chocolate powder or vanilla powder shakes. Each scoop of chocolate powder protein shake contains 20 grams of protein and 4 grams of sugar. Each scoop of vanilla powder protein shake contains 18 grams of protein and 7 grams of sugar. Since she prefers the vanilla flavour, she would like to drink at least twice as many vanilla powder shakes as chocolate powder shakes. However, she must also drink at least 2 scoops of the chocolate powder shake. To avoid high blood glucose levels, she is limiting her consumption to at most 500 grams of sugar over this period of time. How many of each protein shake should the athlete drink to maximize her total protein intake over this period of time?",
