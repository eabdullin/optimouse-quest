The cost for each option along with the expected viewership is given. A magazine ad costs $1000 and attracts 10000 viewers. A flyer costs $200 and attracts 5000 viewers. A billboard ad costs $7000 and attracts 25000 viewers. To avoid annoying customers, the city has limited the number of flyers from a single company to 8. In addition, at most a third of the total number of ads should be billboard ads and at least 15% of the ads should be magazine ads. If the weekly budget is $50000, how many ads of each type should be run in order to maximize the number of viewers?",
