We'll need this to estimate the number of escalators and elevators required.\n\n2. **Foot Traffic:** While the exact number of customers can vary, we can work with an estimate. Could you give a range of the minimum and maximum number of customers you expect on a regular day?\n\n3. **Escalator and Elevator Capacity:** To optimize the number of escalators and elevators, we need to understand their capacity. Do you know how many people an escalator and an elevator can transport per minute?\n\n4. **Budget:** Lastly, installing escalators and elevators comes with a cost. Do you have a budget in mind for this?\n\nPlease provide as much information as you can. If you're unsure about some details, we can make reasonable assumptions and adjust as necessary later."

And how about an elevator?\n\n2. **Mix of Escalators and Elevators:** Do you have a preference for the mix of escalators and elevators? For example, would you like to have more escalators than elevators or vice versa?\n\n3. **Customer Preference:** Have you observed any customer preference for escalators over elevators or the other way round?

Could you tell me more about this? Is there a specific ratio of escalators to elevators you're aiming for, or is it more about fitting as many escalators as possible within your electricity limit?\n\n2. **Customer Flow:** Considering the flow of customers in your mall, is there a particular floor that requires more escalators or elevators? Or should we distribute them evenly across all floors?\n\nYour responses to these questions will help us optimize the number of escalators and elevators in your mall."
