The fast-acting eye drops take 5 minutes per patient to adjust the patient\u2019s pupils while the slow-acting eye drops take 25 minutes per patient. Since the fast-acting eye drops are more expensive, at least twice as many patients must be dilated using the slow-acting eye drops than the fast-acting eye drops. However, at least 25 patients must be dilated with the fast-acting eye drops. If the clinic is open for 15000 minutes, maximize the number of patients that can be dilated.",
