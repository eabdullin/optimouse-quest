These can be treated in different ways to produce three different alloy grades: Standard, Plus or Premium. To produce 1 ton of the Standard grade alloy requires 3 tons of iron ore and 1 ton of zinc ore. To produce 1 ton of the Plus grade alloy requires 5 tons of iron ore and 2 tons of zinc ore. Finally, to produce 1 ton of the Premium grade alloy requires 6 tons of iron ore and 3 tons of zinc ore. The profit per ton from selling the alloys are $1500, $2500 and $5500 for the Standard, Plus, and Premium grades respectively. How much of each alloy grade should be produced to maximize profit?",
