    "problem_statement": "A lumber company owns and can use at most 450 acres of land where they can transport the lumber out using large and small logging trucks. Per acre of land, small logging trucks can be used to transport 3 units of wood. Per acre of land, a large logging truck can transport 7 units of wood. However, a small logging truck produces 12 units of carbon dioxide and requires 7 units of gasoline per acre. A large logging truck produces 25 units of carbon dioxide and requires 12 units of gasoline per acre. The lumbering company has access to 3200 units of gasoline and the company has vowed to limiting pollution to 5200 units of carbon dioxide. How should the two types of logging trucks be distributed to stay within the limits of carbon dioxide while maximizing the amount of wood transported?",
