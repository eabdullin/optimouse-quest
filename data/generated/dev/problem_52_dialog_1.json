    "problem_statement": "Professor ABC sells his economics textbook as paperback or hardcover versions. Paperback books yield a profit of $150 USD whereas hardcover versions yield a profit of $200 USD. Since hardcover versions are more sturdy and contain some extra supplementary materials, there must be at least three times as many hardcover than paperback textbooks. However, because paperback books are less expensive, at least 100 paperback versions must be created. If the professor sells at least 1000 textbooks every year, how many of each version should he request the publisher to print to maximize the profit?",
