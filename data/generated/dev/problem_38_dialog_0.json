Since small cans can be used up quickly and thus, not dry up as easily, the company wants to have at most 30% of the cans be large cans. However, there has to be at least 20 large cans especially for the basic colours. If the company needs to transport at least 120 litres of paint, how many of each size of cans should be transported to minimize the total number of cans?",
