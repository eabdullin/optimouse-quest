Each serving of fruit contains 5 units of the necessary mineral and 3 units of hydration. Each serving of juice contains 7 units of the necessary mineral and 6 units of hydration. According to the nutritionist, the child must intake at least 60 units of the necessary mineral every week and 40 units of hydration for their body to better absorb the mineral into their body. Further, each serving of fruit contains 9 units of sugar and each serving of juice contains 14 units of sugar.
