It takes 7 units of tea leaves and 15 units of filtered hot water to make a cup of black tea. It takes 5 units of tea leaves and 18 units of filtered hot water to make a cup of green tea. The owner of the tea shop has a deal with her distributer to acquire 700 units of tea leaves and 700 units of filtered hot water every week. The tea shop also has a repeating customer in a Japanese restaurant to brew green tea for them. Therefore, the shop must brew at least four times more green tea than black tea. How many of each type of tea should be made to minimize the total time spent brewing tea?",
