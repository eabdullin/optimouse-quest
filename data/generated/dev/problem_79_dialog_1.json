    "problem_statement": "A famous chocolate shop is expecting a lot of orders because of an upcoming holiday. The chocolate shop is famous for selling two products, large boxes of chocolates, or small boxes of chocolates. A large box of chocolate has 24 individual chocolates while a small box of chocolate has 12 individual chocolates. The chocolate shop has a delivery service, and each trip, the shop owner can prepare ahead of time at most 110 large boxes of chocolates or 150 small boxes of chocolates. Due to space limitations of their truck, the truck can fit at most 90 total boxes of chocolates and because of a sale, there must be at least 10 large boxes of chocolates. However, small boxes of chocolates are less expensive and the shop owner expects to move at least three times as many small boxes of chocolates than large boxes of chocolates. How many of each size of chocolate box should the shop owner put in their truck for each trip to maximize the total number of individual chocolates transported to their customers?",
