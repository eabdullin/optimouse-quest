We have two kinds of medications that can be administered - sleeping pills and sleep supplements.\n2.

The sleep supplement also serves to aid sleepiness and carries 2.5 units of sugar discomfort per serving. We need to determine its unit of sleepiness.\n4. There is no restriction on the number of servings for the medications.\n5. The goal is to administer these medicines in such a way that the units of sleepiness adds up to at least 10 but the total sugar discomfort doesn't exceed 2.5 units.\n\nMy last question would be about the sleep supplement's sleepiness unit. How much sleepiness can a serving of the supplement induce in the patient?\n\n"
