    "problem_statement": "A photography firm is planning to open different stores to expand their reach to customers. They can open two types of stores; film-based and electrical-based stores. Since film-based stores take longer to process, there must be at least two times more electrical-based stores than film-based stores. However, management expects film-based stores to become more popular and requires at least 5 film-based stores to be opened. Film-based stores can on average process 2 orders every hour while an electrical-based store can process on average four orders every hour. Film-based stores requires 10 units of electricity every hour while the electric-based stores take 15 units of electricity every hour. Further, the photography firm wants to be able to make at least 170 orders per hour and use at most 600 units of electricity every hour. How many of each store should be opened to minimize the total number of stores?",
