    "problem_statement": "A strawberry farmer has available 225 hectares of land and she needs to harvest the strawberries either through employees or U-pick. For each hectare of land, employees can hand-pick 60 lbs of strawberries which creates 5 lbs of waste, and takes 30 minutes. Conversely, for each hectare of land, opening the farm for U-pick can pick 45 lbs of strawberries which creates 20 lbs of waste, but only takes 20 minutes. The farmer has a maximum amount of people allowed on the field at all times and due to the restriction of trying to sell the product while it is still fresh, expects that at maximum capacity she only has 8000 minutes available for picking. Additionally, there can be at most 6400 lbs of waste. How many hectares should be allocated to each harvesting technique to maximize the amount of strawberries that can be picked?",
