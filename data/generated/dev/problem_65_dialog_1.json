An expert costs the company 500 dollars for each shift and can care for 100 square meters of land whereas an apprentice costs the company 300 dollars for each shift and can care for 80 square meters of land. Because of the price to the customer, the company expects the demand of the public to want at least twice as many apprentices than experts. However, there are loyal customers that prefer the experts. Therefore, at least 10% of shifts must be expert shifts. The company must care for 5000 square meters of land. How many of each type of service should be used to minimize the total cost to the company?",
