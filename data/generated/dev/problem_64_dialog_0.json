Firefighting units can either send units of firefighters or volunteer fire patrols. Firemen can put out 1000 sq ft of fire per trip and takes 10 minutes. Volunteer fire patrols can put out 800 sq ft of fire per trip and takes 12 minutes.

How should the dispatcher allocate resources to each type of firefighting units to maximize the total sq ft that can be put out?",
