Refrigerator ABC is larger and can store 120 items but uses 3 kWh. Refrigerator XYZ is smaller more efficient and can store 80 items but uses 1 kWh. Due to soaring electric prices, the store is limited to at most 55 kWh but must store at least 1500 items. The store must have at least 8 refrigerator ABC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and 5 refrigerator XYZ\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s.
