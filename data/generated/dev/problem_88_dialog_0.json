For each square kilometer of ocean, fish farming causes 8 units of pollution and nets 4 tons of fish and requires 6 workers every day. For each square kilometer of ocean, trawling causes 10 units of pollution, nets 3 tons of fish and requires 2 workers every day. Due to environmental regulations, there must be at most 1700 units of pollution and the company has available 500 workers daily.
