  "problem_statement": "The Vision Corporation manufactures two models of monitors: Aleph 3 and Gilgamesh Supreme. They share a similar manufacturing process in that they both require a certain amount of assembly and packaging. Each Aleph 3 monitor takes 2 hours of assembly and each Gilgamesh Supreme requires 2.5 hours of assembly. They both require 0.5 hours of packaging time per unit. During the next season, 5000 hours of assembly time are available and at most 2500 hours of packaging time may be used. Each Aleph 3 sold yields a profit of $1500. Each Gilgamesh Supreme sold yields a profit of $2500 profit. Formulate and solve this LP problem and find the best combination of monitors that yields the highest profit.",
