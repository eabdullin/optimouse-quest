Based on the information you've provided, let's summarize the key points we will consider to solve this distribution optimization problem:\n\n- You have a network of retail stores to which you need to distribute at least 80 cars.\n- The exact number of cars each retail store needs varies, so you want to optimize the number of trailers used to minimize the cost.\n- A large trailer can carry 6 cars, while a small trailer can carry 4 cars.\n- The cost of using a large trailer is higher than using a small one.\n- The ratio of small trailers used must be at least three times the ratio of large trailers used.\n- It's acceptable if more than 80 cars are transported.\n- There are no restrictions on distance, road rules, or time factors for the trailers.\n\nWith these points in mind, the goal is to distribute the cars to the stores using the least number of trailers while abiding by the rule that the number of small trailers is at least three times the number of large trailers."
