Each logging truck costs the logging company $250 for every trip and moves 1000 lbs of lumber. A lumber carrier vessel costs $1000 every trip and moves 6000 lbs of lumber. Due to limited waters and difficulties in scheduling the trips for lumber carrier vessels, the company\u2019s management asks that the number of logging trucks must exceed the number of lumber carrier vessels. The logging company must transport at least 300000 lbs of lumber to the nearby country. How many of each type of transportation should the company schedule to move their lumber to minimize the total cost?",
