If you spend one hour in area two, you collect 8 units of wood and 3 units of metal. \n\nSo, if we want to minimize the total time spent, we need to think about how to distribute your time between the two areas to collect the required amount of resources as quickly as possible. \n\nLet's start with wood. If you need to collect 50 units of wood, how many hours would you ideally like to spend in each area to achieve this?"

So, if you spend all your time in area one, it would take you 25 hours to collect 50 units of wood. \n\nOn the other hand, if you spend one hour in area two, you collect 8 units of wood. So, if you spend all your time in area two, it would take you a little over 6 hours to collect 50 units of wood.\n\nNow, let's consider the metal. If you spend one hour in area one, you collect 5 units of metal. So, if you spend all your time in area one, it would take you 12 hours to collect 60 units of metal.\n\nHowever, if you spend one hour in area two, you collect 3 units of metal. So, if you spend all your time in area two, it would take you 20 hours to collect 60 units of metal.\n\nBased on these calculations, what do you think would be the best way to distribute your time between the two areas to collect the required amount of resources as quickly as possible?"

Now, let's calculate how many hours you should spend in each area. \n\nTo collect 50 units of wood as quickly as possible, you should spend as much time as possible in area two, since it has a higher collection rate for wood. \n\nIf you spend 7 hours in area two, you will collect 56 units of wood, which is more than you need. But since we're trying to collect resources as quickly as possible, it's okay to collect a bit more than needed. \n\nIn these 7 hours, you will also collect 21 units of metal in area two. \n\nSo, you still need to collect 39 units of metal. If you move to area one, which has a higher collection rate for metal, you can collect the remaining metal in about 8 hours. \n\nSo, the total time spent would be 7 hours in area two and 8 hours in area one, for a total of 15 hours. \n\nDoes this plan sound good to you?"
