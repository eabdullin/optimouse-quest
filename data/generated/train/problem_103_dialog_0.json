Making one PX7 console requires 3 hours of labor and yields a $40 profit. On the other hand, one Silent X console can be produced in 7 hours and offers a greater profit of $75. Given the demand forecast, the business decides to produce at least twice as many PX7 consoles as Silent X ones. In addition, it can spend up to 48 hours a week to manufacture these consoles. Can you help the business determine the number of each console to produced each week to obtain the maximum profit?",
