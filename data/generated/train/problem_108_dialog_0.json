    "problem_statement": "A film agency wants to promote their new movie. They want to maximize the exposure with a budget of at most $500000. To do so, the agency needs to decide how much of the budget to spend on each of its two most effective media: (1) social media adverts and (2) magazine covers. Each social media advert costs $3000; each magazine cover costs $6000. The agency director knows from experience that it is important to use both media. The movie exposure is 100000 viewers for each social media posting and 54000 readers for each magazine cover. He makes a decision that at least 10 but at most 20 social media posts be ordered, and that at least 24 magazine covers should be contracted. How many times should each of the two media be used to obtain maximum exposure while staying within the budget?",
