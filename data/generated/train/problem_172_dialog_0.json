A certain amount of macro nutrients is required each day. For example, here is the data corresponding to chicken and pork and the three macro nutrients (proteins, carbs, and fat). Each serving of chicken contains 20 units of protein, 5 units of carbs, and 6 units of fat. Each serving of pork contains 15 units of protein, 3 units of carbs, and 8 units of fat. A serving of chicken costs $10 and a serving of pork costs $15. Bob's trainer requires him to get at least 100 units of protein, 50 units of carbs, and 30 units of fat per day.
