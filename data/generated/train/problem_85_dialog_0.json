To do so, the company needs to decide how much to allocate on each of its two advertising channels: (1) morning TV show and (2) social media. Each day, it costs the company $1,000 and $2000 to run advertisement spots on morning TV show and social media respectively. The expected daily reach, based on past ratings, is 15,000 viewers for each morning show spot and 30,000 internet users for a social media spot. The chief marketer knows from her experience that both channels are key to the success of the product launch. She wants to plan at least 4 but no more than 7 morning show spots. In addition, the social media spots needs to be at least 30 due to pricing tier policy. How many times should each of the media channels be used to maximize the reach of  the campaign?",
