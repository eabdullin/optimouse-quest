In order to promote their product line, they decided to invest in short commercial spots on two types of programs: concerts and cinema. While each concert commercial is seen by 9 million young girls and 4 million middle-aged women, each cinema commercial is seen by 5 million young girls and 45 million middle-aged women. A 1-minute concert ad costs $80,000, and a 1-minute cinema ad costs $30,000. Avian would like the commercials to be seen by at least 86 million young girls and 72 million middle-aged women. Use linear programming to determine how Avian cosmetics can meet its advertising requirements at minimum cost.",
