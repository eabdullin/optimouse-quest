Based on the information you've provided, here's the strategy to maximize your score:\n\n- You should answer as many calculus questions as possible since they are worth more points.

So, you should aim to answer 15 calculus questions.\n- This leaves you with 10 more questions that you can answer to reach the maximum of 25 questions. These should be algebra questions to meet the requirement of answering at least 10 algebra questions.\n\nSo, to maximize your score, you should aim to answer 15 calculus questions and 10 algebra questions.\n\nNow, let's calculate your maximum score:\n\n- For the calculus questions, you would earn 15 questions * 3 points/question = 45 points.\n- For the algebra questions, you would earn 10 questions * 1 point/question = 10 points.\n\nSo, your maximum score would be 45 points (from calculus) + 10 points (from algebra) = 55 points.\n\nI hope this helps!
