To produce each type of compound, we need to use both an automatic device and a human-operated device. On a given day, each processing device is available for at most 500 minutes. To extract a package of Alnolyte, it takes 5 minutes of processing on the automatic device and 4 minutes on human-operated device. To extract a package of Blenzoate, the automatic device needs to be run for 7 minutes and the human-operated device for 3 minutes. The manufacturer can sell a package of Alnolyte for a revenue of $7 and Blenzoate for a revenue of $10. Assuming that the plant can sell all the compounds it produces, how many packages of each type should be produced daily in order to maximize the revenue?",
