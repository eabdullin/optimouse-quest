5,29,"A grocery store sushi supplier makes sushi in bulk and can purchase either an all-in-one manufacturing line or a decoupled manufacturing line. The all-in-one manufacturing line is more efficient and can output 10000 orders per day while the decoupled manufacturing line can output 7000 items per day.
